\section{Evaluation of the Elegant Objects Paradigm}\label{sec:evaluation-of-the-elegant-objects-paradigm}
\subsection{Evaluation of the Principles}\label{subsec:evaluation-of-the-principles}
This section will evaluate some parts of the elegant object principles and describe some shortcomings.

One issue of the no null principle is that the author suggests the usage of empty objects, like a nobody employee as seen in figure\ \ref{fig:empty-object}.
In the companion blog\footnote{\url{https://www.yegor256.com/2014/05/13/why-null-is-bad.html}} the author writes how null will lead to slowly dying code, instead of failing fast.
He neglects that the usage of these empty objects can also lead to slowly dying code.
It appears like an operation was successful, but when calling specific methods it will result in an exception.
If null is not an acceptable return value, it should result in an exception and not return an empty object.
Otherwise, this pattern will result in code that checks if an object is the same as an empty object.
In other words, more complicated null checks.

\end{figure}

Another questionable principle is described in subsection\ \ref{subsec:no-instanceof-type-casting-or-reflection}.
The author writes on this blog post\footnote{\url{https://www.yegor256.com/2015/04/02/class-casting-is-anti-pattern.html}} that type casting is an anti-pattern.
What the author means is that up-casting is an anti-pattern, as down-casting is required for some of his examples to work.
In Java, in order to not throw an error, an explicit up cast is required, as can be seen in figure\ \ref{fig:up-and-down-casting}

\begin{figure}[h]

    \label{fig:up-and-down-casting}
\end{figure}

The subsection\ \ref{subsec:no-statements-in-test-methods-except-assertthat} explains how using only a single statement in unit tests, makes them reusable.
The problem with this, is that it only works if classes implement a similar, the same interface, or have a similar functionality.
Even then the unit tests often cannot be reused, as there are differences in constructors, for example.
Adhering to an interface and only testing the methods of an interface makes a unit test reusable.
If the interface of two objects is similar enough, the unit tests can be reused.
This can bee seen in figure\ \ref{fig:reused-unit-tests}.
Writing only one statement in a unit test, can also negatively impact readability.
FOr example, figure\ \ref{fig:multiple-statements-can-throw} shows a test, that has multiple method calls in the assert statement.
It is not clear which statement can throw an exception, if all calls are in the assert statement.
If the only call, that can throw an exception, would be isolated, it would be easier to read and understand.

\end{figure}

    \label{fig:multiple-statements-can-throw}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Evaluation of the Prototype}\label{subsec:evaluation-of-the-prototype}
The prototype implements following components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ArrayList
    \item IntegerRange
    \item EventBus
    \item String utils
\end{itemize}
The prototype adheres to the elegant object principles as described in section\ \ref{sec:principles}.
The full source code can be found at \url{https://github.com/flohero/elegant-objects}.

The string utils contain a number of different classes, which simplify working with strings in Java.
They implement the same functionality as the Google Guava Strings class\footnote{\url{https://guava.dev/releases/19.0/api/docs/com/google/common/base/Strings.html}}.
A major difference between Guava and this implementation is that Guava uses static methods, while the prototype uses only objects, since elegant objects does not allow static methods as described in subsection\ \ref{subsec:no-static-methods}.
A majority of the classes do not need a dedicated interface, since they only depend on the \texttt{toString}-method.
The tests are short and can be reused for classes with similar functionality and since nearly all string classes depend on the \texttt{toString}-method the tests are also similarly structured.

The immutable \texttt{ArrayList} implementations needed several workarounds in order to work with elegant objects.
Since elegant objects uses only immutable objects and the iterator interface is inherently mutable, an adapter has to be implemented to restrict mutable code to specific classes.
Figure\ \ref{fig:arraylist-class-diagram} shows the class diagram of the \texttt{ArrayList}.

\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}

\subsection{Developer Experience}\label{subsec:developer-experience}
This subsection describes the developer experience of elegant objects.
By adhering to the elegant object principles, the resulting objects will have a more concise and clearly defined interface.
It also results in code that respects the solid principles, which in turn also make a codebase more maintainable and extensible.

The biggest drawback of using elegant objects with Java is that Java depends heavily on mutable objects.
Therefor, developers using elegant objects have to implement workarounds to limit code where mutable objects are used.
For example the \texttt{Iterator}-interface\footnote{\url{https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Iterator.html}}, as seen in figure\ \ref{fig:iterator}, is per definition mutable.
The \texttt{next())}-method returns the next element in the iteration.
This means an iterator has to depend on an internal state the changes for each iteration.
For the sake of using only elegant object principle where ever possible an immutable iterator is used, which can be adapted to a Java iterator.
This decision required additional work and implementing an adapter only to meet the elegant object principles.
It also limited all mutable code to only a few classes, which made the rest easier to test and read.
In the end the restriction of mutable objects to specific classes increased the readability of the codebase.
As developers can be sure, if an object is successfully constructed its state is valid.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \caption{Iterator Interface}
    \lstinputlisting[language=Java,basicstyle=\tiny,label={lst:iterator}]{assets/code/Iterator.java}
    \label{fig:iterator}
\end{figure}

Tests are more readable by using immutable objects.
The state of an object can be verified, since every method call will return a new object.
The tests are easier to read, since there is only one assert statement.
It made it clear what part of an object is tested.
